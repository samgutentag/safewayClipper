# Installing latest WebDrivers

Gecko Driver can be installed from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Please be mindful of OS version, and be sure to rename the `geckodriver` itself to `geckodriver-version` where `-version` is the Minor version, at time of writing the `geckodriver` file should be named `geckodriver-29`
